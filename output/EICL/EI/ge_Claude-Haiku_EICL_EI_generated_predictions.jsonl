This aligns with the pattern shown in the labeled examples where similar analytical, informational statements are predicted as neutral emotions with probabilities around 0.4-0.66.\n\nWhile \"apprehensive\" is noted as a more likely emotion label, the dialogue context does not demonstrate worry, anxiety, or concern that would characterize apprehension.

The speaker is seeking justification for the accusation through direct questioning, which aligns more closely with \"annoyed\" - a frustrated irritation similar to the labeled example about \"attention to detail\" which was predicted as annoyed with 0.7 probability.
