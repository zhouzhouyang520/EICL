I was so annoyed!\" → (annoyance, 0.8)\n- \"My dog pooped on the rug today. I am so peeved.\" → (annoyance, 0.8)\n\nThe current dialogue has a similar structure to these examples - complaining about dog poop incidents. The phrase \"so tired of stepping in dog poo\" conveys exasperation and frustration rather than disgust at the mess itself.\n\nWhile there could be an element of disgust (given the nature of the complaint), the dominant emotion is the irritation and fatigue from the repeated inconvenient situation, particularly being disturbed at 3am. This aligns more closely with **annoyance** than disgust.\n\nThe \"More likely emotion labels\" guidance also indicates \"annoyed, angry\" should be prioritized, and annoyance is the stronger fit here.\n\nEmotion: annoyance", "index": 1539}
